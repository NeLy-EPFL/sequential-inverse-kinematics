	abstract = {Multibody kinematics optimization (MKO) aims to reduce soft tissue artefact (STA) and is a key step in musculoskeletal modeling. The objective of this review was to identify the numerical methods, their validation and performance for the estimation of the human joint kinematics using MKO. Seventy-four papers were extracted from a systematized search in five databases and cross-referencing. Model-derived kinematics were obtained using either constrained optimization or Kalman filtering to minimize the difference between measured (i.e., by skin markers, electromagnetic or inertial sensors) and model-derived positions and/or orientations. While hinge, universal, and spherical joints prevail, advanced models (e.g., parallel and four-bar mechanisms, elastic joint) have been introduced, mainly for the knee and shoulder joints. Models and methods were evaluated using: (i) simulated data based, however, on oversimplified STA and joint models; (ii) reconstruction residual errors, ranging from 4 mm to 40 mm; (iii) sensitivity analyses which highlighted the effect (up to 36 deg and 12 mm) of model geometrical parameters, joint models, and computational methods; (iv) comparison with other approaches (i.e., single body kinematics optimization and nonoptimized kinematics); (v) repeatability studies that showed low intra- and inter-observer variability; and (vi) validation against ground-truth bone kinematics (with errors between 1 deg and 22 deg for tibiofemoral rotations and between 3 deg and 10 deg for glenohumeral rotations). Moreover, MKO was applied to various movements (e.g., walking, running, arm elevation). Additional validations, especially for the upper limb, should be undertaken and we recommend a more systematic approach for the evaluation of MKO. In addition, further model development, scaling, and personalization methods are required to better estimate the secondary degrees-of-freedom (DoF).},

	abstract = {Discovering the principles underlying the neural and biomechanical control of animal behavior requires a tight dialogue between real experiments and data-driven neuromechanical models. Until now, such models have primarily been used to further our understanding of lower-level motor control. For most whole-animal simulations, we still lack an effective framework for studying how the brain processes environmental signals to regulate motor behavior. The adult fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is well-suited for data-driven modeling and can be simulated using the neuromechanical model, NeuroMechFly. However, until now this simulation framework did not permit the exploration of full hierarchical sensorimotor loops. Here we present NeuroMechFly 2.0, a framework that greatly expands whole-animal modeling of Drosophila by enabling visual and olfactory processing as well as complex three-dimensional environments that can be navigated using leg adhesion. To illustrate its capabilities we explore the effectiveness of biologically-inspired leg controllers for navigating diverse terrain, and show how one can build and use Reinforcement Learning to train an end-to-end hierarchical model with multimodal sensory processing, descending commands, and low-level motor control in closed loop. NeuroMechFly 2.0 can accelerate the discovery of explanatory models of the nervous system and the development of machine learning models to control autonomous artificial agents and robots.},
