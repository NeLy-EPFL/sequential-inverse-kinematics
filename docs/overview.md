# Features

* **Pose alignment:** Align of 3D pose data to a fly biomechanical model, e.g., [NeuroMechFly](https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/NeuroMechFly).
* **Leg inverse kinematics:** Calculate leg joint angles using sequential inverse kinematics.
* **Head inverse kinematics:** Calculate head and antenna joint angles using the vector dot product method.
* **Visualization and animation:** Visualize and animate the results in 3D.
