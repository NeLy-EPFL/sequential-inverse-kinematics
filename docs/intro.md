# 🪰 Overview

`SeqIKPy` is a Python package that provides an implementation of inverse kinematics (IK) that is based on the open-source Python package [IKPy](https://github.com/Phylliade/ikpy). In constrast to the current IK approaches that aims to match only the end-effector, `SeqIKPy` is designed to calculate the joint angles of the fly body parts to align the 3D pose of the entire kinematic chain to a desired 3D pose. In particular, you can use `SeqIKPy` in the pipeline shown below.
